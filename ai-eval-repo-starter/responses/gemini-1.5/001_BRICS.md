The recent expansion of the BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to include countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, and Ethiopia is a significant development with a long-term outlook to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar. However, this challenge is more incremental than revolutionary.

BRICS Expansion and Economic Influence ðŸ“ˆ

The expanded BRICS group now represents a larger portion of the world's population, GDP (by purchasing power parity), and oil production than the G7.  This expanded economic weight and control over crucial resources, particularly oil, gives the bloc more leverage to advocate for a multipolar global financial system. The inclusion of major oil producers like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the UAE is especially critical, as it opens the door for trade in commodities to be settled in currencies other than the dollar.

Challenge to the U.S. Dollar ðŸ’°

The core of the challenge to the U.S. dollar comes from BRICS's push for "de-dollarization." This isn't about creating a single, replacement currency but rather about increasing the use of local currencies in bilateral trade among member states. For example, Russia and China are already conducting a significant portion of their trade in their own currencies. To facilitate this, BRICS is developing alternative financial and payment systems, such as BRICS Pay, to bypass the Western-dominated SWIFT network and reduce vulnerability to U.S. sanctions.




While these efforts are notable, a few factors limit the immediate threat to the dollar's status:

Internal Divergence: The expanded bloc is composed of countries with vastly different political systems, economic models, and even geopolitical rivalries (e.g., Iran and Saudi Arabia; India and China). This heterogeneity makes it difficult to achieve a unified front on economic and financial policy.


Lack of Dollar Alternatives: No other currency possesses the stability, liquidity, and global trust of the U.S. dollar. Most central banks continue to hold the majority of their reserves in dollars and dollar-denominated assets.

Market Depth: The U.S. has deep, liquid financial markets that are unrivaled globally. This makes the dollar the preferred currency for international debt issuance and investment, a status that is difficult to replicate.

In conclusion, while BRICS expansion is a clear signal of a desire to move away from a unipolar, U.S.-led financial order, the shift will likely be gradual. The bloc's efforts will chip away at the dollar's dominance around the edges, but a full-scale dethroning of the greenback remains a distant and unlikely prospect.
