The recent expansion of the BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to include new members like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates marks a significant shift in global power dynamics. This expansion is driven by a shared desire among member nations to challenge the Western-dominated global order and create a more multipolar world.


Outlook for BRICS Expansion ðŸ“ˆ

The future of BRICS expansion is a mixed bag of potential and inherent challenges. On one hand, the expanded "BRICS+" group has substantial economic and demographic weight, representing a significant portion of the world's population and GDP.

This growing influence is a key attraction for aspiring members, who see the bloc as a way to gain diplomatic leverage and secure development financing without the political conditions often imposed by Western institutions like the World Bank and IMF. The bloc is also exploring the creation of alternative financial mechanisms, like the BRICS Pay system, to facilitate trade in local currencies and bypass the SWIFT network.

However, the bloc's internal divisions and heterogeneity pose significant hurdles. The new members have diverse political systems and economic interests, which can make it difficult to achieve a unified, coherent agenda. The geopolitical rivalry between China and India, for example, is a persistent source of friction. The lack of a founding treaty or a centralized administrative body also makes coordinated action challenging.




Challenge to the Dollar ðŸ’µ

The BRICS expansion is viewed as a direct challenge to the US dollar's dominance, but it's a long-term, incremental process rather than an imminent threat. The bloc's primary goal is not to replace the dollar with a single BRICS currency, but rather to de-dollarize international trade by promoting the use of member countries' national currencies. This effort is motivated by a desire to reduce their vulnerability to US economic sanctions and monetary policy decisions.

While some bilateral trade between BRICS nations is now settled in local currencies, the dollar's role as the world's primary reserve and trading currency remains strong. Its deep liquidity, stability, and widespread use in key commodities like oil make it difficult to displace. The addition of major oil producers like Iran and the UAE is a strategic move to facilitate non-dollar oil trades, which could gradually erode the petrodollar's influence.

In conclusion, BRICS expansion is more about building a parallel, alternative system than a direct frontal assault on the existing order. The challenge to the dollar is real, but it will be a gradual process driven by the collective, though often uncoordinated, efforts of member states to diversify their reserves and increase the use of their own currencies in international trade
