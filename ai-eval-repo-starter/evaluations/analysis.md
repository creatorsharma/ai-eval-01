📝 Overall Response Quality (ORQ)

Goal: Judge how good the response is overall, based on major and minor issues across rubrics.

🔹 Categories

Amazing (Cannot be Improved) → No flaws at all. Fully accurate, clear, fluent, relevant, and concise.

Good (Minor Room for Improvement) → No major issues, just a few minor ones. Still fulfills intent well.

Okay → Several minor issues (extra details, small misses, weaker extensions). No major flaws.

Pretty Bad → At least one major issue (incorrect facts, missed intent, poor relevance). May also have minor ones.

Horrible → Multiple major issues, irrelevant or frustrating, fails the user.

📊 Likert Scale (Comparative Ranking)

⚠️ Note: Likert scale is only applicable when comparing two responses.

After scoring each response individually, compare Response A vs Response B on a 1–7 scale:

1 → A much better than B

2 → A better than B

3 → A slightly better than B

4 → A and B about the same

5 → B slightly better than A

6 → B better than A

7 → B much better than A

✅ Final Justification

Always explain why you gave the ranking.

Point out specific errors or strengths with evidence from the responses.

Show why the issue matters (e.g., “incorrect fact misleads the user” or “tone mismatch reduces clarity”).

Keep it concise but consistent with the rubric ratings.
