Comparative Evaluation Report: GPT-5 vs Claude Sonnet-4 vs Gemini 2.5 Flash

Context

All three models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet-4, and Gemini 2.5 Flash) produced impressive, accurate, and well-structured responses to the given task. However, their performance diverged in user engagement and follow-up strategy, which became the key differentiator.

GPT-5 Performance
G
PT-5 not only answered the query with clarity and completeness but also extended the conversation with a meaningful follow-up. This follow-up served two functions:

Rapport Building → Made the interaction feel more conversational and human-like.

Engagement → Encouraged the user to keep exploring the topic further, preventing the dialogue from feeling transactional.

Depth Expansion → Demonstrated the model’s ability to “keep digging” rather than simply closing the answer.

This aligns with advanced conversational qualities expected in next-gen LLMs: proactive engagement, empathy signaling, and sustained dialogue management.

Claude Sonnet-4 & Gemini 2.5 Flash Performance

Both Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5 Flash gave high-quality, precise, and contextually correct answers. However, they lacked any follow-up or re-engagement cues. While their responses were technically sound and well-structured, they ended the conversation abruptly.

Claude Sonnet-4 → Strong reasoning and clarity, but no continuation prompt.

Gemini 2.5 Flash → Concise and informative, but static and non-interactive.

This limited their ability to foster rapport or encourage further dialogue.

Key Takeaway

GPT-5 > Claude & Gemini in engagement, rapport building, and conversation depth.

While Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5 Flash perform at par in accuracy and structure, their lack of follow-up reduces user stickiness.

In the long run, adopting engagement strategies like GPT-5’s proactive follow-up could significantly improve user satisfaction and sustained usage for Claude and Gemini.
